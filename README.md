The graph “karate” contains the network of friendships between the 34 members of a karate club at a US university, as described by Wayne Zachary in 1977. I applied interesting graph theory properties and techniques to the social network to understand how each person in the club was connected. Analyzed eccentricities, diameters, periphery, girth, connectedness, articulation, cliques, degrees, and the PageRank Algorithm.
